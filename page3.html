<h1>Campaign Characters</h1>
<p>This page shows the characters I have played in actual campaigns, and somewhat of an origin for the power builds I have made</p>

    Elven Fighter
    </label>
    <p>Classes:<br>5lvl Fighter(Champion)<br>The first character I made to play in a proper campaign was a 5th level champion fighter with elven accuracy so I could crit more often on creatures in the dungeon we were running.

    Kalashtar Druid
    </label>
    <p>Classes:<br>11lvl Druid(Moon)<br>The character I'm playing currently is a Kalashtar moon druid. The group I was joining needed a wise character as the group had a problem with failing wisdom saves so I decided to play a race with advantage on those saves and a class that focuses on wisdom. The racial ability of Kalashtar to speak telepathically has also been useful to communicate in with my pary while I'm in wildshape.

    Tiefling Bard (Different TTRPG)
    </label>
    <p>The first TTRPG I played was a game called Dungeons the Dragoning, which was an incedibly complicated TTRPG that, if I'm honest, I wouldn't recommend. The game was very unbalanced as it had been written by one person and wasn't playtested but it was the first game I was able to play so I took the oppurtunity. I managed to inadvertantly make a bruild that could end most encounters with just casting one spell that no monster could make the save for.

<h1>Home Page</h1>    
<p>This website shows all the characters I have played in Dungeons and Dragons 5e in my time playing it. These characters are split into 2 groups, the characters I've played in oneshots, and the ones Ive played in campaigns.</p>
<h2>Level 20 PvP and PvE</h2>
<p>This page will showcase the characters in the oneshots I have played. These oneshots were organised on a server dedicated to finding the most broken builds that D&D 5e can offer, finding and sharing ridiculous combinations or classes, subclasses, spells and items.</p>
<h2>Campaign Characters</h2>
<p>This page will showcase the characters in the campaigns I have played. These will be different to the oneshots I have played as they aren't purely focused on being the best in combat, but are made to work over the course of multiple sessions in social, exploration and combat encounters. These characters were also made with more depth as they were made to fit into the story.</p>
<h3>5e tools</h3>
<p>5e tools is a site that has resources from all Dungeons and Dragons sourcebooks. This is where I've linked to items I've used and is also useful for researching race, class, spells and creature sheets for transforming into.</p>
